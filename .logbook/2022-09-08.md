Arrived to a cabin by a lake in Michigan yesterday. It's really nice and warm here. I won't be working much while here but felt compelled to make some progress on the virtual memory page allocator.

I've been thinking about using existing procedures for allocation, like the heap I wrote for the generic allocator or the buddy allocator used by the memory manager (for managing host memory.) It took me a while to realize that neither of those would work here since the vm_map_add and del functions would need to manage a separate structure (heap_t or buddy structure.) Plus, the vm_map implementation needs to support allocation of arbitrary number of pages; the buddy allocator is limited to allocating ranges that are power of two in size. Anyhow, I decided to implement `vm_map_findspace` tailored to vm_map.
