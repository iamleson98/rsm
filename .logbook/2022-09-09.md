Found a little time this morning to tinker with `vm_map_findspace`.
Trying a (potentially effective?) trick for minimizing misses when starting the search by tracking the minimum VFN that's free, in `vm_map_t.min_free_vfn`. When `vm_map_findspace` starts a search, it adjusts the desired minimum vaddr to min_free_vfn if needed and starts the search there.

A realization about page table size "classes": Since the vm_map is constructed from a hierarchy of page tables (currently four levels, 6 bits of address per level), I can skip certain levels and focus on others depending on the number of pages requested for allocation. For example, if 800 pages are requested I know that an L4 page table won't be enough, so any L4 table that is not _completely empty_ can be skipped. (This algorithm is quite similar to `bits_set_range` and `bitset_find_unset_range`.)

Each page table level has an increment of VM_PTAB_BITS (6 bits, currently) capacity
- L1_size 68719476736 pages
- L2_size   134217728 pages
- L3_size      262144 pages
- L4_size         512 pages

I.e.

    L4_size = VM_PTAB_LEN;
    L3_size = L4_size << VM_PTAB_BITS;
    L2_size = L3_size << VM_PTAB_BITS;
    L1_size = L2_size << VM_PTAB_BITS; // root
