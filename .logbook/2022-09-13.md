Back home and spent the full day working on `vm_map_findspace`.

I ended up breaking down the problem into two smaller problems:
1. Iterating over pages in the vm_map
2. Finding free regions of pages (using the iterator function)

And it works! Code is still disabled because it's really messy,
but tomorrow I'll clean it up and do some more testing.
