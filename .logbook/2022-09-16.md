Separated vm_map code into separate source files as the vm.c file was getting too big.
Finished a working implemention of vm_map_add using vm_map_iter today and improved the vm_map_iter API along the way. However vm_map_iter still has a bug where the VFN is not correctly calculated; it is relative to the current table, not absolute.
