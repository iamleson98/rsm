Over the past few days I've been reworking the virtual memory management functions: iter, add, del, access etc. Some were sketch quality (like del) and others suffered from messy implementation (like add) while there were several bugs crawling around.

Now stack splitting works, which is used as a test case for virtual memory management as it does all the things except access: grow, find empty spac, add mappings and delete mappings. All at non-trivial addresses.

I need to leave for a meeting now but later this afternoon (or whenever I get to it) I'll be looking at eliding stack splitting when stkmem_grow is able to expand the stack.
