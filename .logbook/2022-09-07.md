Started implementing vm_map that can find "any suitable virtual address", like an allocator. Inspired by FreeBSD's API, I changed (cleaned up?) the vm API. vm_pagedir_t is now called vm_map_t ("virtual memory map") and functions vm_map and vm_unmap were renamed to vm_map_add for adding a mapping and vm_map_del for removing a mapping.

Doing all this I also realized that having an old-style brk/sbrk API for the process heap is just a dumb idea, so I ripped out the heap code from the scheduler's memory layout function. Instead, a process that needs a heap can:
- Allocate an initial heap by defining data, e.g. `data initheap i8[4096]`
- Allocate additional memory pages during runtime to grow its heap with `syscall(SC_MMAP)`
