Okay I implemented eliding of stack splitting when stkmem_grow can expand the current stack by mapping in pages just above the current stack (at lower addresses.) It was pretty trivial. However is comes at the cost of a non standard task-stack size (after a stack is grown) which means tasks with enlarged stacks can't be reused. In some distant future it could be interesting to measure if this actually has a real-world impact or not. It probably hasn't. Plus, I want RSM to be as simple as it can be, taking on complexity cost only when it has a clear benefit.
